# Autoclick
Chrome Extenstion to Autoclick hyperlink when mouse hover on any hyper link is more than 1.5sec
History: At one time grease monkey had user script which could autoclick URL when moverover was more that 1.5 sec,
But now grease monkey is no their and user scritps are gone.
I miss it badly hence making an attempt to come up with chrome extension which will do the same thing.
